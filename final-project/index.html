                    <p>Daphne Alston used to go to every funeral.</p>
                    <p>
                        A co-founder of Mothers of Murdered Sons and Daughters
                        United, Alston has worked with hundreds of families
                        here, helping them navigate the pain, paperwork and
                        logistics that come with each killing. But recent years
                        have brought such a spike in violence that there are now
                        too many funerals for Alston to attend. She has enlisted
                        other members of her group to help her with outreach to
                        the families of the slain, sometimes going to three or
                        four funerals each day of the weekend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A key component of that outreach was once helping
                        families endure the legal proceedings that followed —
                        and sitting next to them during the trials. But this
                        year the court cases are scant. Alston knows of just a
                        few killings for which anyone has been arrested.

                        As Baltimore has seen a stunning surge of violence, with
                        nearly a killing each day for the past three years in a
                        city of 600,000, homicide arrests have plummeted. City
                        police made an arrest in 41 percent of homicides in
                        2014; last year, the rate was just 27 percent, a 14
                        percentage point drop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of 50 of the nation’s largest cities, Baltimore is one
                        of 34 where police now make homicide arrests less often
                        than in 2014, according to a Washington Post analysis.
                        In Chicago, the homicide arrest rate has dropped 21
                        percentage points, in Boston it has dropped 12 points
                        and in St. Louis it is down 9.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Baltimore is also one of 30 cities that have seen an
                        increase in homicides in recent years, with the greatest
                        raw number increase in killings of any city other than
                        Chicago, which has four times the population. While
                        homicide rates remain near historical lows in most
                        American cities, Baltimore and Chicago are now both
                        seeing murder tallies that rival the early 2000s.

                    <p>
                        The wave of violence here began not long after the April
                        2015 death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man
                        arrested in West Baltimore and placed — hands cuffed and
                        legs shackled — in the back of a police van. There, he
                        suffered a severe neck injury and lost consciousness. He
                        died in the hospital about a week later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gray’s death prompted massive protests that at times
                        turned to riots. The years since have come with a
                        documented officer slowdown — patrol officers say they
                        are hesitant to leave their vehicles and have made fewer
                        subjective stops of people on Baltimore’s streets. That,
                        coupled with a crisis of police legitimacy as residents
                        express distrust and frustration with the force, has
                        fueled a public safety emergency in parts of the city,
                        community leaders say.

                        “It’s an open market, open season for killing,” said
                        Alston, whose son Tariq was murdered in 2008. “After
                        Freddie Gray, things just went berserk.”

                    <p>
                        While there is evidence for and against a nationwide
                        Ferguson effect — the theory that crime increased after
                        2014 as police faced more scrutiny following the
                        shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. — in
                        Baltimore there is an indisputable Freddie Gray effect.
                        As violence in the city has risen since 2015, the
                        likelihood of a killer being arrested has dropped
                        precipitously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For most of the decade before 2015, Baltimore’s annual
                        homicide arrest rate hovered at about 40 percent. Since
                        2015, the arrest rate hasn’t topped 30 percent in any
                        year. And while most cities saw their arrest rates drop
                        gradually, Baltimore’s decline was sudden — plummeting
                        15 percentage points in 2015, after Gray’s death, the
                        largest single-year drop for any city already solving
                        less than half its homicides.

                        “Our clearance rate isn’t what I think it should be,”
                        Baltimore Police Commissioner Gary Tuggle, who has been
                        running the department on an interim basis since May,
                        said in an interview. “We’ve got a really, really
                        talented homicide unit, but we’re understaffed.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tuggle, who noted that violent crime is down from its
                        peak levels last year, said that the depressed arrest
                        rate is due to a combination of factors. In many cases,
                        detectives struggle to find cooperative witnesses.
                        Police grapple with community relationships still deeply
                        singed by the unrest that followed Gray’s death. And,
                        perhaps most crucial, the department’s homicide
                        detectives are overwhelmed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each Baltimore detective, on average, now is responsible
                        for nine homicide cases and, with other suspicious
                        deaths factored in, about 31 total active cases, Tuggle
                        said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A Post analysis of homicides nationwide found that major
                        police departments that have success in making arrests
                        generally assign detectives fewer than five cases a
                        year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Our average caseload per detective is far higher than
                        it should be,” Tuggle said. “Generally, if we can’t
                        clear a case and get it off of the board within the
                        first 25 days, chances are it’s going to be a lot
                        longer. If we can ever get it off of the board at all.”

                        Community leaders and residents say that leaves hundreds
                        of families who have been robbed of a loved one without
                        a chance at seeing justice done. Of the 1,002 homicides
                        between 2015 and the beginning of this year, just 252 —
                        one out of every four — resulted in an arrest.

                        detective is confident that someone witnessed my son’s
                        murder, but people are scared to come forward because of

                        seen 22 more homicides in the three-year period since
                        Gray’s death than it did in the three years before he
                        died. Southwest Baltimore saw its homicides rise by 35,
                        and Greater Rosemont has seen 26 more since 2015.

                        In each of those neighborhoods, police make an arrest in
                        fewer than 25 percent of cases, including 16 percent in
                        Sandtown-Winchester.

                        These areas long have been among the city’s most
                        economically depressed and, because of years of
                        residential segregation, populated almost exclusively by
                        low-income black residents.

                        “This structural violence contributes to the street
                        violence that we see,” said Lawrence Brown, a Morgan
                        State University professor who coined the term Baltimore
                        butterfly in 2015. “What hypersegregation does is that
                        it distorts social dynamics. You don’t have resources in
                        these communities, and people have to fight for every
                        little crumb. And then comes the violence that ends up
                        on the evening news.”

                        Local criminologists and activists say that the surge in
                        violence and the police department’s low success rate in
                        solving homicides is directly linked to the deep
                        distrust both highlighted and stoked by Gray’s death.

                    <p>
                        “This boils down to the relationship between communities
                        and police,” said Tara Huffman, director of criminal and
                        juvenile justice programs at Open Society
                        Institute-Baltimore. “They need people to come forward,
                        they need people to answer the door when they knock, and
                        they need people to talk to them on the scene.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “You cannot coerce that,” she said. “You can beg and
                        plead all you want to. If the relationship is screwed
                        up, you’re simply not going to get the help that you
                        need to solve these crimes.”

                    <p>
                        And those relationships, never great, have been further
                        damaged within a few tumultuous years.

                        First came Gray’s death. Then state’s attorney Marilyn
                        J. Mosby announced that she would charge six of the
                        officers involved, enraging the local police union and,
                        some local leaders say, further encouraging officers to
                        police less actively. Many Baltimore community leaders
                        fear that shift helped drive the uptick in violence.

                        Prosecutors failed to secure a single conviction in the
                        case — abandoning the prosecutions after a mistrial and
                        two acquittals — prompting a new round of anger from
                        residents who wanted to see officers held accountable.

                        In the meantime, city and police department leaders were
                        locked in tense negotiations with the U.S. Justice
                        Department, which launched an investigation after Gray’s
                        death and ultimately concluded that Baltimore police
                        regularly violated residents’ civil rights.

                    <p>
                        “This is a city where law enforcement has felt massively
                        under siege, and where there was one of the worst police
                        killings ever for which there was no accountability,”
                        said Phil Goff, president of the Center for Policing
                        Equity, which works with police departments across the
                        country.

                    <p>
                        Then another policing scandal arose: Eight members of an
                        elite “Gun Trace Task Force” pleaded guilty or were
                        convicted in federal court of widespread abuses across
                        Baltimore. An investigation found that officers set
                        people up for baseless searches, stole property and
                        money from residents, and carried toy guns to plant on
                        people.

                    <p>
                        “All of the things that could happen to a police
                        department to create a culture of murder with impunity
                        are all happening in Baltimore,” Goff said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The department also was grappling with near-constant
                        leadership upheaval, including three police
                        commissioners just this year.

                    <p>
                        As the murder rate soared, Mayor Catherine Pugh (D)
                        fired Police Commissioner Kevin Davis in January and
                        replaced him with Darryl De Sousa, who in turn resigned
                        just four months later after facing federal charges of
                        failing to file tax returns. De Sousa later pleaded
                        guilty to the charges.

                        Tuggle has run the show since May as an interim
                        commissioner. The mayor’s choice to replace him, current
                        Fort Worth Police Chief Joel Fitzgerald, is awaiting
                        city council confirmation but the secretive process by
                        which he was selected has raised skepticism that was
                        further stoked when he refused to provide the Baltimore
                        Sun with a copy of his résumé.

                    <p>
                        “We have an unstable department,” said Ray Kelly, chief
                        executive of the No Boundaries Coalition of Central West
                        Baltimore, an activist group that has been involved in
                        police reform efforts. “It’s just a whole lot of chaos
                        that we have to get beyond before we can start seeing
                        any change.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tuggle acknowledged that the leadership shake-ups have
                        had some impact on the department’s ability to prevent
                        and solve crime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “The department really needs a level of continuity, and
                        I’m really hopeful that going forward they’ll get that,”
                        he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tuggle also emphasized strides he believes the
                        beleaguered department has made in the months since he
                        took over. He said homicides are down about 10 percent
                        from last year, and that in recent months violence has
                        begun to decline even in some of the city’s most
                        difficult zones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For that, Tuggle credits the city’s violence reduction
                        initiative, in which city agencies work to focus social
                        services and resources on the city’s most violent
                        neighborhoods, meeting at 8 a.m. daily to strategize.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I certainly see the relationship between the community
                        and the police improving. I’ve seen substantial
                        improvement since I’ve been here,” Tuggle said. “There
                        is a sense of urgency on the police department’s part to
                        get justice for each and every victim that is out
                        there.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But as cases go unsolved, a growing roster of family
                        members of the slain are frustrated with what often
                        feels to them like an inadequate effort to bring them
                        closure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “When people have been traumatized and they don’t get
                        the justice that they need, it makes them distrustful,”
                        said the Rev. Andre H. Humphrey, commander of the
                        Baltimore Trauma Response Team, a group of chaplains
                        that helps police respond to violent crime scenes. “Not
                        just of law enforcement, but of everyone.”

                        On the second Sunday afternoon of every month, a dozen
                        or so mothers and fathers of homicide victims gather
                        around folding tables spread across the crimson carpet
                        of a meeting room at St. John’s Alpha and Omega
                        Pentecostal Church in West Baltimore.

                    <p>
                        The church sits a short walk from where Freddie Gray was
                        taken into police custody, and just a few blocks up
                        North Avenue from the CVS that was torched during the
                        riots and has since been rebuilt. The rest of this area
                        looks, more or less, unchanged from 2015: a desolate
                        maze of boarded-up rowhouses, crowded liquor stores and
                        underattended churches.

                        December’s gathering started a bit behind schedule,
                        though, because Alston had trouble getting to the
                        church. There had been a shooting just a few blocks
                        away, so she had to detour around the crime scene.

                        Daphne Alston closes her eyes as she listens to James
                        Dixon speak about police efforts to solve homicides.
                        “It’s an open market, open season for killing,” Alston
                        said of Baltimore. “After Freddie Gray, things just went
                        berserk.”

                        Each meeting begins with an open floor, in which
                        families of victims can give updates on their cases.
                        Then guests have the opportunity to talk about community
                        programs or upcoming events.

                    <p>
                        In 2016, the Baltimore Police Department hired two
                        victim-witness advocates, who work with the homicide
                        unit and aim to help families affected by slayings. At
                        the recent meeting, the gathered mothers heard from
                        James Dixon, one of those advocates.
                    </p>
                    <p>He quickly sensed skepticism and frustration.</p>
                    <p>
                        Dixon assured the group that the department is doing
                        everything in its power to bring their loved ones’
                        killers to justice. He said his very job was a sign of
                        those efforts — since Baltimore is one of just a few
                        major cities with full-time victims’ services staff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it’s a challenge, he said. Often, the leads that the
                        mothers hear on the street don’t pan out. In other
                        cases, witnesses who share details with the family of
                        the slain clam up when police approach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’s easy to beat up on the police and say that they’re
                        not doing their job,” said Dixon, clad in a tan suit and
                        yellow bow tie, as he paced the front of the room. “At
                        the end of the day, if there’s not a witness . . . ”
                    </p>
                    <p>And then the debate began.</p>
                    <p>
                        The gathered women peppered Dixon with questions,
                        prompting round after round of disagreement. The mothers
                        said they feel like some victims are treated differently
                        than others, but Dixon insisted that’s not true. Dixon
                        suggested that the community needs to be more
                        cooperative with police and with prosecutors. The
                        mothers seemed unconvinced.

                        After about 2½ hours, the meeting adjourned, with Alston
                        even more dissatisfied than she was when it began.

                        “People are losing their children every single day, and
                        everybody profits off of our pain but nobody wants to
                        hear our cry,” Alston said, downtrodden as she put on
                        her coat and headed out the sanctuary’s side door. “I
                        guess we have to just keep going to funerals.”
