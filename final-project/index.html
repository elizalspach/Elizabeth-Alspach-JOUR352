                        Daphne Alston used to go to every funeral.</p> 
                    <p>A co-founder
                        of Mothers of Murdered Sons and Daughters United, Alston
                        has worked with hundreds of families here, helping them
                        navigate the pain, paperwork and logistics that come
                        with each killing. But recent years have brought such a
                        spike in violence that there are now too many funerals
                        for Alston to attend. She has enlisted other members of
                        her group to help her with outreach to the families of
                        the slain, sometimes going to three or four funerals
                        each day of the weekend.
